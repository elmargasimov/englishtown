Please start server with python before you open:
1) $cd [/folder]
2) $python -m SimpleHTTPServer

The way forward:

1) Add footer
2) Add images and icons
3) Cleanup width, lines to become full width and add grid (12 col, 20px gutter, 940px width) (usually I would do this first)
4) Responsive site

I would create a responsive site by using CSS media queries to a screen width of 410px max.

@media only screen 
and (min-device-width : 320px) 
and (max-device-width : 410px) { /* STYLES GO HERE */}

From there edit the table so it collapses and make sure the rest of the content looks nice.

5) W3 compliant test
6) Browser cross consistent test
